# Text-Embeddings-For-Determining-Spam
This repo contains a csv file comprising more than 5000 SMSs containing spam and ham (not spam) SMSs. I downloaded this file from Kaggle.com. I used this SMS data to train a spam classification machine learning model, using OpenAI's "text-embedding-3-small" model. The code for converting the text data into embedding vectors and training the model is in the Jupyter Notebook file. The original Notebook was created for a live webinar to showcase the use of AI in a Cybersecurity setting.
